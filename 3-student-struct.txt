Code Explanation

The code above implements a menu-driven program in C++ for managing student records. Here's a breakdown of the code:

    We start by defining a struct Student that represents a student record. It contains variables for student_id, name, age, and marks.

    We define a constant MAX_STUDENTS to limit the maximum number of students that can be stored in the program. We also declare an array students of type Student to store the student records, and an integer numStudents to keep track of the number of students currently stored.

    The createStudentRecord function allows the user to create a new student record. It prompts the user to enter the student ID, name, age, and marks, and stores the record in the students array.

    The displayStudentRecord function takes an index as input and displays the student record at that index. It checks if the index is valid and then prints the student's ID, name, age, and marks.

    The searchStudentByID function takes a student ID as input and searches for a student with that ID in the students array. If a match is found, it calls the displayStudentRecord function to display the student's record. If no match is found, it prints a message indicating that the student was not found.

    The displayAverageMarks function calculates and displays the average marks of all the students in the students array. It first checks if there are any students stored and then calculates the total marks by iterating over the array. Finally, it calculates the average marks and prints the result.

    The displayStudentWithHighestMarks function finds the student with the highest marks in the students array and calls the displayStudentRecord function to display their record. If no students are found, it prints a message indicating that no students were found.

    In the main function, we implement the menu-driven logic using a do-while loop. The user is presented with a menu of options and prompted to enter their choice. Based on the choice, the corresponding function is called. The loop continues until the user chooses to exit by entering 0.

That's it! You now have a menu-driven program in C++ that allows you to manage student records. You can compile and run the code to test it out and perform various operations on the student records.
